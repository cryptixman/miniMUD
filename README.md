miniMUD (by C. Steffen)
=======================

The purpose of **miniMUD** is to provide a simple, straightforward, extensible MUD server, written entirely in Python, with no additional libraries required. The base framework should support any type of ruleset you might desire, with minimal effort.

This MUD does not come with any built-in rules for things like combat, skills, magic, or anything like that. The rules for those types of things are up to you.

If you want a purely social MUD, you could feasibly run miniMUD as-is, but most admins will want to add functionality to the system. For this reason, I have designed miniMUD to be well-commented, well-organized, and fairly simple to comprehend.

If you have any questions about miniMUD, please direct them to `'puevf@rybdhragzrff.pbz'.encode('rot13')`.
