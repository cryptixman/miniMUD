# This file defines custom emotes. Genders should be separated by a forward-slash (/) and male should preceed female.
# Each emote has three parts, separated by a colon (:).
# The first part is the emote command.
# The second part is the aimless command, for when there are no targets specified.
# The third part is the targeted command, for when the user specifies a target.
