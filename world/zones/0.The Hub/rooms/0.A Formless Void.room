# A description of the room. Ends with '---'.
description:
    You are surrounded by a formless white light, infinitely bright yet not painful to the eye. There is no way to know the bounds of this space, if indeed it has bounds at all.
    The only possible exit seems to come from an incredibly dark portal nearby. The light from this place seems to be leaking into the black expanse beyond the portal.
