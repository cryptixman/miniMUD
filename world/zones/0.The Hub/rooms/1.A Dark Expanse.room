# A description of the room. Ends with '---'.
description:
    All about you is a vast expanse of black nothingness. There is no light anywhere around you, making it quite difficult to determine the size of the area around you. For all you know, it could be infinite.
    The only exception is a white oval portal in the center of the room. Tendrils of energy seem to emanate from within.
