- Design user login system.
  - States still required:
    IF THEY ARE NEW:
    * verify_name -- make sure they picked the right name.
      - yes? choose_password
      - no?  get_name
    * new_password -- get their new password
      - set the local password, then verify_password
    * verify_password -- get the password again, to be sure it matches
      - yes? choose_gender
      - no?  new_password
    * choose_gender -- male or female? (don't bother with others)
      - Is gender legit? verify_character
      - If not, choose_gender again
    * verify_character -- show them the entire character so far, and make sure it's all good.
      - If not, start over. Clear set variables then get_name
      - If so, save new character and set status to authenticated.
    
    Now, when the character's state reaches 'authenticated,' load them into their room so they see their surroundings. Then set their status to 'live.'
