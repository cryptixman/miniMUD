TODO

- Figure out how to use "help" and populate it with commands and give information about the game.
- Prevent users from registering names that are reserved. (Commands, already registered names, NPCs, items, etc.)
- Add color.
- Set up zone reset without booting users. (Specified zones or all zones.)

FUTURE IDEAS

- Work out a way to say "So and so arrives from the north." Basically, reverse-lookup the exit in the current room that references the room a user arrived from.
  If there is no exit, simply say "They arrived." Otherwise, say "They arrived from the %exitname%."

UPDATE NOTES
- Fixed the exit bug. Now if there are no exits from the room, it says 'None' instead of being blank.
- Fixed a bug where users trying to access invalid exits would crash the game. Now they are dropped into 0.0 by default.
