TODO

- Fix exits so that if there are no exits, show 'None' instead of a blank.
- Fix system so that if the user can't be placed in their last location, they are placed in 0.0 by default.
- Figure out how to use "help" and populate it with commands and give information about the game.
- Prevent users from registering names that are reserved. (Commands, already registered names, NPCs, items, etc.)
- Add color.
- Set up zone reset without booting users. (Specified zones or all zones.)
