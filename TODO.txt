FUTURE IDEAS

- Limit output to a specified number of lines. Allow users to hit enter or type 'continue' to finish outputting the line, or type any other command
  to clear the buffer and do something else. This should be automatic. Max 20 lines.
- Even better, if we can somehow determine the size of the terminal our player is using, we can make this automatic.
