TODO

- Add the 'who' command.
- Figure out how to use "help" and populate it with commands and give information about the game.
- Prevent users from registering names that are reserved. (Commands, already registered names, NPCs, items, etc.)
- Set up zone reset without booting users. (Specified zones or all zones.)

FUTURE IDEAS

- Work out a way to say "So and so arrives from the north." Basically, reverse-lookup the exit in the current room that references the room a user arrived from.
  If there is no exit, simply say "They arrived." Otherwise, say "They arrived from the %exitname%."

UPDATE NOTES
- Added color.
- Fixed the problem where users can say and emote nothing.
